### Application Import/Export with `winget`

This PowerShell script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to simplify the process of exporting and importing your installed Windows applications using the `winget` command-line tool. It's a handy way to back up your application list and restore it on another machine.

### Features

-   **Export Applications**: Generates a CSV file and a JSON manifest file listing all applications detected by `winget list`. The CSV is easy to read, while the JSON is the format required for the import function.
-   **Import Applications**: Uses the JSON manifest file to automatically install all applications that were previously exported.
-   **User-friendly GUI**: A simple interface allows you to browse for a file path, and provides a progress bar and verbose output to track the process.
-   **Robust Parsing**: The script uses a regular expression to reliably parse the text output of `winget list`, ensuring that application names with spaces and other details are captured correctly.

### How to Use

1.  **Save the Script**: Save the code as a `.ps1` file (e.g., `winget-gui.ps1`).
2.  **Run with PowerShell**: Right-click the script and select **Run with PowerShell**.
3.  **Export**:
    -   Click the **Browse** button to choose a location and file name for your export files.
    -   Click **Export Applications**. The script will create both a `.json` manifest and a `.csv` file.
4.  **Import**:
    -   Place the `.json` file you created on the machine you want to set up.
    -   Click the **Browse** button and select the `.json` file.
    -   Click **Import Applications**. `winget` will then begin installing all the listed applications.

### Script Details

The script is a self-contained PowerShell GUI built with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and runs without needing any additional modules.

-   **`buttonExport.Add_Click`**:
    -   Executes `winget list` to get a list of all applications.
    -   Uses a regular expression (`^(?<Name>.*?)\s{2,}(?<Id>\S+)\s{2,}(?<Version>\S*)\s{2,}(?<Source>\S+)$`) to parse the output and capture the Name, Id, Version, and Source of each application.
    -   Generates a formatted CSV file for easy viewing.
    -   Generates a `winget`-compatible JSON manifest file from the same parsed data for use with the import function.

-   **`buttonImport.Add_Click`**:
    -   Reads the path to the JSON manifest file from the text box.
    -   Executes the command `winget import -i [file_path]` to install the applications listed in the manifest.
